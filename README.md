## Problem Statement – Expense Management

Companies across industries face challenges with managing employee expense reimbursements. Traditional processes are often  **manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors** , leading to frustration for employees and inefficiencies for finance teams.

The key problems include:

* Lack of transparency in the approval process.
* No simple way to define  **multi-level approval workflows** .
* Inability to set **conditional rules** (e.g., percentage-based approvals or specific authority overrides).
* Delays in processing due to scattered communication between employees, managers, and finance teams.
* Difficulty in handling expenses in **multiple currencies** for global teams.
* Dependence on manual data entry, which increases errors and risks of fraud.

### What is needed?

An **intelligent expense management system** that provides:

1. **User Management** – Employees, Managers, and Admins with clearly defined roles and permissions.
2. **Expense Submission** – Easy claim submissions with support for receipts, multi-currency, and categorization.
3. **Approval Workflows** – Configurable multi-level approval processes with sequential and conditional rules.
4. **Conditional Rules Engine** – Support for percentage-based approvals, specific approver overrides, or hybrid models.
5. **Transparency** – Employees and managers can track status at every stage.
6. **Automation** – OCR-powered receipt scanning to reduce manual entry.
7. **Integration** – Currency APIs for real-time conversion, ensuring financial accuracy.

   Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)
   NOTE: The expense is first approved by his manager, if the IS MANAGER
   APPROVER field is checked.
   When multiple approvers are assigned, Admin can define their sequence.
   ○ Example:
   Step 1 → Manager
   ○ Step 2 → Finance
   ○ Step 3 → Director
   Expense moves to the next approver (approval request generated in next
   approver’s account) only after the current one approves or rejects.
   Managers can:
   ○ View expenses waiting for approval.
   ○ Approve/Reject with comments.
   Conditional Approval Flow
   Approval Rule supports:
   ○ Percentage rule: e.g., If 60% of approvers approve → Expense approved.
   ○ Specific approver rule: e.g., If CFO approves → Expense auto-approved.
   ○ Hybrid rule: Combine both (e.g., 60% OR CFO approves).
   There can be a combination of both flows(Multiple approvers + Conditional)
   together as well.

   Additional features :
   OCR for receipts (auto-read)
   ○ Employees can just scan a receipt and using OCR algorithm the expense gets
   autogenerated with all necessary fields like amount, date, description, expense
   lines, expense type, name of restaurant(for e.g) where this expense was done.
