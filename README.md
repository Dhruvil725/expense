## Problem Statement – Expense Management

Companies across industries face challenges with managing employee expense reimbursements. Traditional processes are often  **manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors** , leading to frustration for employees and inefficiencies for finance teams.

The key problems include:

* Lack of transparency in the approval process.
* No simple way to define  **multi-level approval workflows** .
* Inability to set **conditional rules** (e.g., percentage-based approvals or specific authority overrides).
* Delays in processing due to scattered communication between employees, managers, and finance teams.
* Difficulty in handling expenses in **multiple currencies** for global teams.
* Dependence on manual data entry, which increases errors and risks of fraud.

### What is needed?

An **intelligent expense management system** that provides:

1. **User Management** – Employees, Managers, and Admins with clearly defined roles and permissions.
2. **Expense Submission** – Easy claim submissions with support for receipts, multi-currency, and categorization.
3. **Approval Workflows** – Configurable multi-level approval processes with sequential and conditional rules.
4. **Conditional Rules Engine** – Support for percentage-based approvals, specific approver overrides, or hybrid models.
5. **Transparency** – Employees and managers can track status at every stage.
6. **Automation** – OCR-powered receipt scanning to reduce manual entry.
7. **Integration** – Currency APIs for real-time conversion, ensuring financial accuracy.
